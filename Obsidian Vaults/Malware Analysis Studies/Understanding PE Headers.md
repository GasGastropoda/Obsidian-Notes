just for reference before you get to all this fancy stuff, you'll see a lot about WORD and DWORD. These are fancy labels for how much space a number will take up in memory. Here's a chart:


| Label | Byte Amount | Example                 |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| BYTE  | 1 Byte      | 00                      |
| WORD  | 2 Bytes     | 00 00                   |
| DWORD | 4 Bytes     | 00 00 00 00             |
| QWORD | 8 Bytes     | 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |


# [PE Header Fundamentals: The First Step in Malware Analysis](https://astra-labs.co/posts/PE-Header-Funamentals-The-First-Step-in-Malware-Analysis/)

## What is PE Format?
- format used by windows executables, object code, and DLLs
- data structure containing information needed for the winOS to manage wrapped code
- almost every file loaded by windows is in PE
- begin with a **header** that includes information about: 
	- the code
	- the type of application
	- the required library functions
	- space requirements

## What are PE Headers?
- the file format is made up of the header, and then a ton of sections.

## Imports and Exports of a PE File
- **Imports**:
	- functions/libraries that the executable needs to interact with the OS. the functions are loaded from DLLs, enabling the binary to perform sys-level operations (file handling, network communication, memory management)
- **Exports**:
	- functions or symbols made available by the binary to be used by other executables or libraries. Provided by DLLs to share functionality (APIs or reusable code) with other programs. Allows external programs to call into the binary and use its features.
