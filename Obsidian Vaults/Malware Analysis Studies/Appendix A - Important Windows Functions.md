| accept                     | listen for incoming connections. Indicates that the program will listen for incoming connections from a socket.                                                                                                                      |
| AdjustTokenPrivileges      | enables or disables specific access privileges. Malware that performs process injection will call this function to gain additional permissions                                                                                       |
| AttachThreadInput          | attaches the input processing for one thread to another so that the second thread can receive inputs such as keyboard and mouse events. Keyloggers and other spyware use this function.                                              |
| bind                       | associates a local address to a socket to listen for incoming connections                                                                                                                                                            |
| BitBlt                     | copies graphic data from one device to another. Spyware uses this function to capture screenshots. often added by the compiler as a part of library code.                                                                            |
| CallNextHookEx             | used within code that is hooking an event set by `SetWindowsHookEx` . `CallNextHookEx` calls the next hook in the chain. make sure you analyze the function that calls this one to determine the function of the `SetWindowsHookEx`. |
| CertOpenSystemStore        | accesses certificates stored on the local system                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent | checks to see if a specific process is being debugged. sometimes used a part of an anti-debugging technique                                                                                                                          |
| CoCreateInstance           | creates a COM object. the Class Identifier (CLSID) will tell you which file contains the code that implements the COM object.                                                                                                        |
| connect                    | connects to a remote socket. malware often uses this low-level functionality to connect to a C2 server                                                                                                                               |
