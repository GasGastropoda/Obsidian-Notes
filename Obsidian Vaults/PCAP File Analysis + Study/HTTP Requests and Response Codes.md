HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the reason for a request and what is expected if the request is successful. Sometimes referred to as "HTTP Verbs". Each request method has its own specifics, but some characteristics are shared. HTTP request methods can be:
	- **Safe:** doesn't alter the state of the method (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS). All safe methods are idempotent, but not all idempotent methods are safe.
	- **Idempotent:** the effect is similar to that of making several identical requests to a server
	- **Cacheable:** response that can be stored and used later

## Table of HTTP Request Methods

| 304  | Not Modified       | used for caching. Tells the client that the response has not been modified, so the client can continue to use the same cached version of the response.                                                                             |

| 307  | Temporary Redirect | directs client to get the requested resource at another URI with the same method used in the prior request. Has the same semantics as 302 Found with the exception that the user agent must not change the method used.            |
| 308  | Permanent Redirect | resource is permanently located another URI, specified by the Location response header. same semantics as 301 Moved Permanently HTTP response code, with the exception that the user must not change the HTTP method used.         |

| 408  | Request Timeout                 | sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without previous request by the client. means the server would like to shutdown this unused connection. used much more since some browsers use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed up browsing. Some servers may shut down a connection without sending this message.                               |
| 409  | Conflict                        | sent when request conflicts with current state of server. in WebDAV remote web authoring, they're errors sent to the client so that a user might be able to resolve a conflict and resubmit the request                                                                                                                                                  |
