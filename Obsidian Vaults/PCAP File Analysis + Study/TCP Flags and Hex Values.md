| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Synchronization (SYN - 2 - 0x02 )  | First step of the 3-way handshake process between two hosts. The first packet sent from the sender and receiver should have this flag set. Used for synchronizing sequence number (telling the other end in what order they should accept)                                        |
| Acknowledgement (ACK - 16 - 0x010) | used to acknowledge packets successfully received by the host. Flag is set if the acknowledgement number field contains a valid value                                                                                                                                             |
| Finish (FIN - 1 - 0x01)            | used to request connection termination. Last packet sent by the sender. Frees reserved resources and terminates the session.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Reset (RST - 4 - 0x04)             | used to terminate the connection if the sender feels something is wrong with the TCP connection or a feeling that the conversation should not exist.                                                                                                                              |
| Urgent (URG - 32 - 0x20)           | indicates that data contained in the packet should be prioritized and handled urgently by the receiver. used in combination with the Urgent Pointer field to identify the location of the urgent data within the packet                                                           |
| Push (PSH - 8 - 0x08)              | requests immediate data delivery to the receiving host, without waiting for additional data to be buffered on the sender's side. Commonly used in applications such as real time audio or video streaming                                                                         |
| Window (WND)                       | used to communicate the size of the receive window to the sender. window size is the amount of data that the receiving host is capable of accepting at any given time. sender should limit the amount of data it sends based on the size of the window advertised by the receiver |
| Checksum (CHK)                     | verifies the integrity of the TCP segment during transmission. Checksum is computed over the entire segment, including header and data fields, and is recalculated at each hop along the network path.                                                                            |
| Sequence Number (SEQ)              | unique number assigned to each segment by the sender to identify the order in which packets should be received by the receiver. used in conjunction with the acknowledgement number to ensure reliable data transfer and to prevent duplicate packets.                            |
| Acknowledgement Number (ACK)       | used to acknowledge the receipt of a TCP segment and to communicate the next expected sequence number of the sender. the acknowledgement number field contains the sequence number of the next expected segment.                                                                  |
